    Start a regular terminal (NOT a root terminal), then use your preferred editor (’nano’ in my 	case) to create and open a new file:

	$ nano .local/share/applications/android-studio.desktop
	or gedit

	In the new file, enter the following lines:

      	[Desktop Entry]
      	Type=Application
      	Encoding=UTF-8
      	Name=Android Studio
      	Comment=Google Programming IDE for Android
      	Exec=/home/(your_login_name)/android-studio/bin/studio.sh
      	Icon=/home/(your_login_name)/android-studio/bin/studio.png
      	Terminal=false

    	If you decide to cut-and-paste the above text, make sure to replace (your_login_name) with 		your actual login name. Save the file and exit the editor.

    	Reload the Gnome shell by executing first ‘Alt-F2’ and then typing ‘r’ in the resulting 	‘Enter a Command’ field, followed by the ‘Enter’ key.

    	If you now click on the ‘Activities’ menu item, then on the ‘Show Applications’ icon 		(usually the last icon in the dock), you will find the ‘Android Studio’ launcher in the 	applications list (see below). To add the ‘Android Studio’ launcher to the ‘Favourites’ in 		the dock, right-click on the launcher icon in the applications list and select ‘Add to 		Favourites’ item in the window that pops up. To test the launcher, you can click on either 		icon – Android Studio should launch.
